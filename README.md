## 📊 Key Insights & Visualizations
### 1. Predictable Movies, Disposable Series?
A comparative analysis of content duration reveals a dual strategy. While movies adhere to a traditional cinema-standard runtime (concentrated between 85-120 minutes), the vast majority of TV Shows have only one season. This suggests a "market-testing" model for series, where only guaranteed hits are renewed, and a low-risk, familiar format approach for movies.
